/*
A heap in Java is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies 
the heap property. There are two main types of heaps -
    Max-Heap - The value of each node is greater than or equal to the 
    values of its children. The largest value is always at the root.
    Min-Heap - The value of each node is less than or equal to the values 
    of its children. The smallest value is always at the root.

Characteristics -
    Heaps are not implemented as a class
    Heaps are often implemented as a binary tree.
    They are typically used to implement priority queues.
    Efficient operations -
        Insertion - O(logn)
        Deletion (removal of root) - O(logn)
        Peek (accessing root) - O(1)

Implementation in Java -
    Java provides a built-in class for heaps called PriorityQueue, 
    which by default implements a min-heap.

Binary Tree - Atmost 2 children

Complete Binary Tree - Binary Tree in which all the levels are completely
filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

Heap Order Property -
    Children >= Parent (minHeap)
    Children <= Parent (maxHeap)
