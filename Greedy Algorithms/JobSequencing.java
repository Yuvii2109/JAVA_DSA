// Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and profit if 
// the job is finished before the deadline, it is also given that every
// job takes a single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline of
// any job is 1. Maximise the total profit if only one job can be scheduled
// at a time. "Job - deadline, profit"
// Job A - 4, 20
// Job B - 1, 10
// Job C - 1, 40
// Job D - 1, 30
// Output - C, A
