/*
    Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

    Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

    Example 1 -
        Input - words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
        Output - ["i","love"]
        Explanation - "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
        Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

    Example 2 -
        Input - words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
        Output - ["the","is","sunny","day"]
        Explanation - "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
