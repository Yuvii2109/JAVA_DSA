/*
    You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete. Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build. 

    Example 1 -
        Input - n = 5
        Output - 2
        Explanation - Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

    Example 2 -
        Input - n = 8
        Output - 3
        Explanation - Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
